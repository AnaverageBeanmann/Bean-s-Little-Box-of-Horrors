-- ENT.Information 	= "Rank: Pursuer.\nType: Human, Proxy.\n\n'The Henderson family was found dead in their home today after sheriffs performed a wellness check in response to none of the family members being seen for two days.'\n'The eldest son, Ethan, was nowhere to be found during the investigation, and his current whereabouts are not known.'\n'While many details about this gruesome tragedy have not been publicly shared, word spread that Ethan's room was found covered in papers with strange scribbles on them, some showing what seems like a tall, human-like figure.'\n\nThe Psycho has four states: Stalking, Hunting, Exhausted, and Furious. He starts off in his Stalking phase.\nDuring the Stalking phase, he will watch targets from a distance for an indeterminant amount of time.\nAfter that time passes, warning cues will play, and he'll enter the Hunting phase not long after.\nDuring the Hunting phase, he'll attempt to attack you with his axe, losing stamina every swing.\nLooking at him will cause him to sprint, while running and looking away will cause him to teleport directly infront of you (which costs stamina).\nWhen he runs out of stamina, he enters the Exhausted phase, and you can now finally lose him by running away.\nAfter losing him, he goes back to the Stalking phase and the cycle repeats.\nYou can choose to fight back during the Hunting phase, which will knock him down temporarily... but he'll get back up soon after, and enter the Furious state.\nFurious is similar to Hunting, but he's more aggressive and instead of a stamina meter, you have to survive a certain amount of time before he enters the Exhausted state.\n\n"
